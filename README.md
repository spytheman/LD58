# Description
*Event: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/58*

*Date: Saturday October 4th to Tuesday October 7th, 2025 ; starts at 1:00 AM EEST*

*Format: The Compo - 48 hour deadline, solo, from scratch (as much as is reasonable), and share your source code.*

*Theme: Collector*

# Ideas:
* walk around maze(s) (mario, sokoban, flappybird, pacman, keen, wolfenstain/doom ?)
* collect items
* shoot monsters
* jump over pits and on platforms?
* a timer expires (remaining time gives bonus points)?
* until the player hits some dangerous objects/pits/monsters?
* each item gives some ability/score

# Alternative idea:
Goal: collect all the garbage items from a garden/forest into different bins.
Time bar gradually fills up, when it is full, the game round ends and stats are shown.
After a click, another level loads up, and the game continues.
Soft ambient forest sounds/music is played in the background the whole time.
Sounds can be toggled on/off with the `m` key, or by clicking a button, next to the bins.
Items are randomly placed on the screen.
Items gradually become transparent, until they disappear completely.
Different items last for longer.
4 bins at the bottom of the screen, each selectable by clicking, or by the 1,2,3,4 keys.
Each item has to be clicked, while the matching bin at the bottom is selected -> + points.
If the wrong item is put in a bin, -> - points.
Different sounds are played when items are matched to the bins, like "nice", "yesss", "Yippee" etc.
Different sounds are played when items are misplaced, like "nooo", "tz", "nope" etc.
